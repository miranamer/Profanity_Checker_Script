# Profanity Checker Script
Simple Profanity Checking Script - Was created to be used by my form tutor in year 12 to screen videos for profanity before viewing in class

<h2>How It Works:</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Find YouTube Video To Check Against</li>
  <li>Copy Video ID (Example URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) In this case the ID is the bit after 'v=' </li>
  <li>ID in this example would be: dQw4w9WgXcQ </li>
  <li>Enter ID into function to return no of swears and timestamps</li>

</ul>

<h2>Future Plans:</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Turn script into chrome extension</li>
  <li>Allow extension to automatically skip over timestamps involving profanity</li>

</ul>
